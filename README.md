 ## Pond size
 
 
 The integer matrix representing a plot of land and water. Values of 0 represents water, while numbers > 0 represent land. A pond is a region of water connected vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The size of the pond is the number of connected water cells.
 
 Compute the sizes of all ponts in the matrix.
 
 Ex:
 
 ```
 0	2	1	0
 0	1	0	1
 1	1	0	1
 0	1	0	1
 ```
 
 Output: 2, 4, 1 (in any order)
